MAYAVI X11 BUG

Note for linux running : There is a screw up in the offscreen rendering engine
of mayavi, which pops up a window even though we have requested offscreen
rendering.  These windows do not die as they should after the engine is
deleted, and end up clogging the X-server (and crashing the plotting code) if
too many of them hang around.  To fix this :
+ install xvfb package (sudo aptitude install xvfb)
+ add the following in front of the ./plot_locations.py in your running script:
  xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 0 1024x768x24"
